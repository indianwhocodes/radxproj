# Recursive make - makes the subdirectory code
#
# This makefile makes all the current RAP libraries used by OWPDT.
#
# NOTE: If you do a 'make -k install' with this Makefile you may get the
#	following unexpected behavior: even if a submodule of a library fails 
#	to build, the library may still be installed. To prevent this, write
#	a script to go through all the libraries in the SUB_DIRS list, go
#	to each library directory and do a 'make install'.
