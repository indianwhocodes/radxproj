                  Universal Format Radar Tape Structure
		  =====================================
                  

Universal format tapes conform to the following five specification:

 1. 9 track tapes, 1600 or 6250 cpi density. [Now extended to other media]
 2. 16-bit words, signed integers, 2's complement.
           [Note that words are "big-endian" (most significant byte at end of word)]
 3. Physical records, length <= 4095 words.  [Record lengths now < 65536 bytes.]
 4. File marks between volume scans (volumes).
 5. ASCII words are left justified, blank filled.

    3   Position of first word of nonmandatory header block.  (If no
         nonmandatory header block exists, this points to the first
         existing header block following the mandatory.  In this way,
         word (3) always gives 1 + the length of the mandatory header.
    4   Position of first word of local use header block.  (If no local
          use headers exist, this points to the start of the data
          header block.)
